# Haystack Router (Interaction)

This skill is for **interacting** with Haystack Router through Algorand MCP tools — getting quotes, executing swaps, and checking opt-in status. All operations use the Algorand MCP wallet for signing; no SDK installation or API keys needed.

Haystack Router is a DEX aggregator and smart order routing protocol on Algorand. It finds optimal swap routes across multiple DEXes (Tinyman V2, Pact, Folks) and LST protocols (tALGO, xALGO), then executes them atomically through on-chain smart contracts.

## Algorand MCP Haystack Router Tools

Three dedicated Algorand MCP tools provide full Haystack Router functionality. These handle quoting, execution (with wallet signing), and opt-in checking — no raw mnemonics or secret keys needed.

### `api_haystack_get_swap_quote`

Get an optimized swap quote without executing. Use to preview pricing, route, and price impact before confirming with user.

```
→ api_haystack_get_swap_quote {
    fromASAID: 0,             // Input asset (0 = ALGO)
    toASAID: 31566704,        // Output asset (USDC)
    amount: 1000000,          // 1 ALGO in base units
    type: "fixed-input",      // or "fixed-output"
    address: "<address>",     // optional, for opt-in detection
    maxGroupSize: 16,         // optional
    maxDepth: 4,              // optional
    network: "mainnet"
  }

Returns: expectedOutput, inputAmount, usdIn, usdOut, userPriceImpact,
         route, flattenedRoute, requiredAppOptIns, protocolFees
```

### `api_haystack_execute_swap`

All-in-one swap: quote → sign (via wallet) → submit → confirm. Uses the active wallet account for signing.

```
→ api_haystack_execute_swap {
    fromASAID: 0,             // Input asset
    toASAID: 31566704,        // Output asset
    amount: 1000000,          // Amount in base units
    slippage: 1,              // 1% slippage tolerance
    type: "fixed-input",      // optional
    note: "my swap",          // optional text note
    maxGroupSize: 16,         // optional
    maxDepth: 4,              // optional
    network: "mainnet"
  }

Returns: status, confirmedRound, txIds, signer, nickname, quote details,
         summary (inputAmount, outputAmount, totalFees, transactionCount)
```

### `api_haystack_needs_optin`

Check if an address needs to opt into an asset before swapping.

```
→ api_haystack_needs_optin {
    address: "<address>",
    assetId: 31566704,
    network: "mainnet"
  }

Returns: { address, assetId, needsOptIn: true/false, network }
```

## Algorand MCP Agent Swap Workflow

```
Step 1: Check wallet
  → wallet_get_info { network }

Step 2: Check opt-in (if swapping to an ASA)
  → api_haystack_needs_optin { address, assetId, network }
  → If needed: wallet_optin_asset { assetId, network }

Step 3: Preview quote (recommended — show user before executing)
  → api_haystack_get_swap_quote { fromASAID, toASAID, amount, address, network }
  → Present to user: expected output, USD values, route, price impact

Step 4: User confirms → Execute
  → api_haystack_execute_swap { fromASAID, toASAID, amount, slippage, network }
  → Returns confirmed result with summary

Step 5: Present transaction links
  → Extract txIds array from api_haystack_execute_swap response
  → Present each txId as a clickable explorer link:
    Mainnet: https://allo.info/tx/{txId}
    Testnet: https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/{txId}
```

**Key rules:**
- Always check wallet with `wallet_get_info` before any swap
- Always confirm with the user before executing (show quote details)
- The execute tool handles signing via the active wallet — no manual signing needed
- Default to testnet during development; confirm before mainnet
- Quotes are time-sensitive — execute promptly after user confirms
- After execution, **always present each txId** from the response as a clickable explorer link (mainnet: `https://allo.info/tx/{txId}`, testnet: `https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/{txId}`)

## CRITICAL: Swap Direction Rules

The `type` parameter determines whether the `amount` is the exact input or the exact output. **Getting this wrong means the user spends or receives the wrong amount.**

### How to parse user intent

| User says | Means | `type` | `amount` is | `fromASAID` | `toASAID` |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| "Buy 10 ALGO with USDC" | Want exactly 10 ALGO out | `"fixed-output"` | 10000000 (the ALGO) | USDC | ALGO |
| "Buy 10 USDC with ALGO" | Want exactly 10 USDC out | `"fixed-output"` | 10000000 (the USDC) | ALGO | USDC |
| "Sell 10 ALGO for USDC" | Spend exactly 10 ALGO | `"fixed-input"` | 10000000 (the ALGO) | ALGO | USDC |
| "Swap 10 ALGO to USDC" | Spend exactly 10 ALGO | `"fixed-input"` | 10000000 (the ALGO) | ALGO | USDC |
| "Use 10 ALGO to buy USDC" | Spend exactly 10 ALGO | `"fixed-input"` | 10000000 (the ALGO) | ALGO | USDC |
| "Buy USDC for 10 ALGO" | Spend exactly 10 ALGO | `"fixed-input"` | 10000000 (the ALGO) | ALGO | USDC |
| "Get me 5 USDC" | Want exactly 5 USDC out | `"fixed-output"` | 5000000 (the USDC) | (ask user) | USDC |

**Rules:**
1. **"Buy X of Y"** → user wants exactly X of Y as output → `type: "fixed-output"`, `amount` = X in base units, `toASAID` = Y
2. **"Sell/swap/convert X of Y"** → user wants to spend exactly X of Y as input → `type: "fixed-input"`, `amount` = X in base units, `fromASAID` = Y
3. **"Buy Y for/with X of Z"** → user specifies exact input spend → `type: "fixed-input"`, `amount` = X in base units, `fromASAID` = Z
4. **If ambiguous, ASK the user** — never guess. Wrong direction = wrong amount spent/received.

### fixed-input vs fixed-output behavior

- **`fixed-input`**: The `amount` field is the **exact input** the user will spend. The output varies based on market price. User knows exactly what they pay.
- **`fixed-output`**: The `amount` field is the **exact output** the user will receive. The input varies based on market price. User knows exactly what they get.

## Key Concepts

- **Amounts** are always in base units (microAlgos for ALGO, smallest unit for ASAs)
- **ASA IDs**: 0 = ALGO, 31566704 = USDC, etc.
- **Quote types**: `fixed-input` (default) — specify input amount; `fixed-output` — specify desired output
- **Slippage**: Percentage tolerance on output (e.g., 1 = 1%). Applied to the final output, not individual hops
- **Routing**: Supports multi-hop and parallel (combo) swaps for optimal pricing
