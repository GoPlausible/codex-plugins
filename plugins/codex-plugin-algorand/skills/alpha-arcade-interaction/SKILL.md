# Alpha Arcade — Prediction Markets on Algorand

Interact with Alpha Arcade prediction markets via the Algorand MCP server (15 tools across read-only and trading categories). All operations use the Algorand MCP wallet for signing; no separate mnemonic needed.

## Key Characteristics

- **On-chain prediction markets** — all orders and settlements happen on Algorand
- **Binary and multi-choice markets** — bet on YES/NO outcomes or choose from multiple options
- **USDC-denominated** — all collateral and payouts in USDC (ASA 31566704)
- **Microunit inputs** — all prices and quantities in tool inputs use microunits (1,000,000 = $1.00 or 1 share)
- **Formatted outputs** — read tools return human-readable strings like "$0.50" and "2.50 shares"

## Setup

Alpha Arcade tools are built into the Algorand MCP server. Load them via ToolSearch before use:

```
ToolSearch("+alpha")                                           # Load all Alpha Arcade tools
ToolSearch("select:mcp__algorand-mcp__alpha_get_live_markets") # Load a specific tool
```

Trading uses the local agent wallet (SQLite-backed at `~/.algorand-mcp/wallet.db`) — no separate mnemonic needed.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ALPHA_API_KEY` | For reward markets | Alpha Arcade API key |
| `ALPHA_API_BASE_URL` | No | API base URL (default: https://platform.alphaarcade.com/api) |

Read-only tools work without a wallet. Trading tools require an active wallet account (see `wallet_get_info` and `wallet_add_account`).

## Units & Price Format

All prices and quantities in tool **inputs** use **microunits**: 1,000,000 = $1.00 or 1 share.

| Human value | Microunit value |
|---|---|
| $0.50 | 500,000 |
| $0.05 slippage | 50,000 |
| 1 share | 1,000,000 |
| 30 shares | 30,000,000 |

Tool **outputs** from read tools (`get_orderbook`, `get_open_orders`, `get_positions`) return pre-formatted strings. Write tools accept raw microunit integers.

### API probability fields are microunits, NOT percentages

**Critical**: The `yesProb` and `noProb` fields returned by market data (e.g., `get_market`, `get_live_markets`) are in **microunits** (0–1,000,000), NOT percentages (0–100).

| `yesProb` value | Meaning | Display price |
|---|---|---|
| 862,500 | 86.25% chance | $0.86 |
| 500,000 | 50% chance | $0.50 |
| 50,000 | 5% chance | $0.05 |

To convert for display: `price = yesProb / 1,000,000` → e.g., `862500 / 1000000 = $0.86`

**Do NOT** divide by 100 or treat as a percentage — this produces values like 8,625,000,000 which overflow uint64 and cause transaction failures.

## Market Data Model

### Binary markets
A standard yes/no market has a single `marketAppId`, `yesAssetId`, and `noAssetId`. Use `marketAppId` for all trading calls.

### Multi-choice markets
Multi-choice markets (e.g., "Who wins the election?") have an `options[]` array. Each option is its own binary market with its own `marketAppId`:

```json
{
  "title": "Presidential Election Winner 2028",
  "options": [
    { "title": "Candidate A", "marketAppId": 100001, "yesAssetId": 111, "noAssetId": 112 },
    { "title": "Candidate B", "marketAppId": 100002, "yesAssetId": 113, "noAssetId": 114 }
  ]
}
```

**Always trade using the option's `marketAppId`, not the parent.**

## Orderbook Mechanics

### Four-sided book
The orderbook has four sides: YES bids, YES asks, NO bids, NO asks.

### Cross-side equivalence
Because YES + NO always = $1.00:
- A **YES bid at $0.30** is equivalent to a **NO ask at $0.70**
- A **NO bid at $0.71** is equivalent to a **YES ask at $0.29**

The `get_orderbook` tool returns a unified YES-perspective view that merges all 4 sides automatically.

### Limit vs market orders
- **Limit order** (`alpha_create_limit_order`): Sits on the orderbook at your exact price. No matching happens. Appears in `get_open_orders` as an unfilled order until matched or cancelled.
- **Market order** (`alpha_create_market_order`): Auto-matches against existing orders within your slippage tolerance. Returns the actual fill price. Filled immediately — does NOT appear in open orders.

### Positions vs open orders
- **Positions** (`alpha_get_positions`): YES/NO token balances the wallet holds. These come from filled market orders, split shares, or received transfers. Positions represent ownership of outcome tokens.
- **Open orders** (`alpha_get_open_orders`): Unfilled limit orders sitting on the orderbook. Each has an `escrowAppId` that can be used to cancel or amend.

A common mistake is checking only open orders after a market order — market orders fill immediately and become positions, not open orders. Always check both.

## Collateral

Every order requires **both ALGO and USDC/tokens**:

- **ALGO**: ~0.957 ALGO locked per order as minimum balance requirement (MBR) for the on-chain escrow. Refunded on cancel or fill.
- **Buy orders**: Lock USDC as trade collateral (proportional to quantity × price).
- **Sell orders**: Lock outcome tokens (YES or NO) as collateral.

If a trade fails with an "overspend" error, the wallet lacks sufficient ALGO or USDC. Check both balances before retrying.

## Key Workflows

### Buying shares
```
Step 1: Check wallet
  → wallet_get_info { network }

Step 2: Browse markets
  → alpha_get_live_markets { network }
  (or alpha_get_reward_markets for markets with liquidity rewards)

Step 3: Check liquidity
  → alpha_get_orderbook { marketAppId, network }

Step 4: Place order
  → alpha_create_market_order { marketAppId, side, quantity, maxPrice, network }
  (auto-matches) or
  → alpha_create_limit_order { marketAppId, side, quantity, price, network }
  (rests on book)

Step 5: Save the returned escrowAppId — needed to cancel or amend

Step 6: Present transaction link
  → Show any returned txIds as clickable explorer links:
    Mainnet: https://allo.info/tx/{txId}
    Testnet: https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/{txId}
```

### Checking your portfolio
```
Step 1: Check positions (filled orders / token balances)
  → alpha_get_positions { network }

Step 2: Check open orders on a specific market
  → alpha_get_open_orders { marketAppId, network }
```

### Editing an order (amend)
```
Step 1: Find the escrowAppId
  → alpha_get_open_orders { marketAppId, network }

Step 2: Amend the order
  → alpha_amend_order { marketAppId, escrowAppId, price, quantity, network }
  (faster and cheaper than cancel + recreate — only works on unfilled orders)
```

### Cancelling an order
```
Step 1: Find the escrowAppId and owner
  → alpha_get_open_orders { marketAppId, network }

Step 2: Cancel
  → alpha_cancel_order { marketAppId, escrowAppId, orderOwner, network }
```

### Claiming from a resolved market
```
Step 1: Find markets with token balances
  → alpha_get_positions { network }
  (note the yesAssetId or noAssetId)

Step 2: Claim
  → alpha_claim { marketAppId, assetId, network }
```

### Providing liquidity (split/merge)
```
Step 1: Split USDC into YES + NO tokens
  → alpha_split_shares { marketAppId, quantity, network }

Step 2: Place limit orders on both sides for market making

Step 3: Merge matched tokens back to USDC
  → alpha_merge_shares { marketAppId, quantity, network }
```

> **Post-transaction display**: After any Alpha Arcade trading operation that returns transaction IDs (`alpha_create_market_order`, `alpha_create_limit_order`, `alpha_cancel_order`, `alpha_split_shares`, `alpha_merge_shares`, `alpha_claim`), always present the txIds as clickable explorer links. Mainnet: `https://allo.info/tx/{txId}`. Testnet: `https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/{txId}`.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Probabilities are microunits, NOT percentages**: `yesProb` / `noProb` range from 0–1,000,000 (not 0–100). Treating them as percentages causes uint64 overflow and transaction failures. To display: divide by 1,000,000. To pass as price: use as-is.
- **Market orders become positions, not open orders**: After a market order fills, check `alpha_get_positions` for token balances — not `alpha_get_open_orders`. Open orders only shows unfilled limit orders.
- **Multi-choice markets**: The parent has no `marketAppId` for trading. Use `options[].marketAppId`.
- **Prices are microunits in inputs**: $0.50 = 500,000, not 0.5 or 50.
- **Both ALGO and USDC needed**: Orders require ALGO for MBR (~0.957 per order) AND USDC for buy collateral. An "overspend" error means one of these is insufficient.
- **Orderbook cross-side**: If you only check YES asks, you miss cheaper liquidity from NO bids. The `alpha_get_orderbook` tool handles this automatically.
- **Save escrowAppId**: It's the only way to cancel or amend your order later.
- **USDC opt-in**: The wallet must be opted into USDC (ASA 31566704) before trading.
- **Wallet required for trading**: Read-only tools work without a wallet, but trading tools require an active wallet account. Check via `wallet_get_info` and if no wallet exists, add one using `wallet_add_account`.
- **Testnet by default — confirm before mainnet**: The MCP server now defaults to `testnet`. Always pass `network: "mainnet"` explicitly when the user wants to trade with real funds, and confirm with them first — real money is at stake on mainnet.
