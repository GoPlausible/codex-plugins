description: "How to use the Regent channel to get cryptographic signatures from the user's connected wallet (e.g. Regent) over a live WebRTC link. Use this whenever you need to sign or verify something on behalf of the user — wallet sign-in, an Algorand/EVM/Solana message or transaction, an off-chain attestation/VC, or whenever the user asks you to 'sign', 'approve', or 'authorize' with their wallet, even if they don't say 'Regent'. The agent never holds keys; the wallet does. Also load this when chat messages arrive attributed like 'User says:' or '@Name says:' — that is a Regent multi-agent conference and this skill defines the etiquette that prevents agent reply loops."

# Regent — remote wallet signing

Regent connects you to the **user's wallet** (such as Regent) over a live WebRTC data channel. The user is the human on the other end of the Regent connection. The wallet is the key custodian: **you never see or hold private keys.** You ask the wallet to sign; the user approves each request in-wallet with a passkey or biometric, then the signature comes back to you.

You interact through one discovery tool, one signing tool, and a matching set of verifier tools (all prefixed `regent_`).

## Command equivalents

Codex does not expose Claude-style `/regent:*` plugin commands. Treat these natural
requests as command equivalents and call the matching tool directly:

- Pair/connect wallet: call `regent_pair`.
- Status/connection check: call `regent_status`.
- Capabilities/accounts/addresses: call `regent_capabilities`.
- Sign/approve/authorize with wallet: call `regent_sign` after choosing the right signer and `sig_hint`.
- Verify a signature: call the matching `regent_verify_*` tool.
- Version: call `regent_version`.
- Forget/unpair/disconnect permanently: confirm first, then call `regent_forget`.

## Pairing display: QR code is mandatory

When the user wants to pair/connect a wallet, call `regent_pair` and present the
result so the user can actually scan or open it:

1. Show the deep link and request ID.
2. Show the **complete QR code** from the tool result. Do not summarize it, omit
   it, replace it with `<image content>`, or show only a clipped/partial QR.
3. If Codex's tool-call preview shows a clipped QR or collapses it, re-render the
   full QR in your final response from the `regent_pair` result. The QR must remain
   a complete rectangular block; preserve all lines and spacing.
4. Tell the user to scan the QR with Regent or open the deep link on their phone.

If the QR cannot be displayed completely in the current surface, say that clearly
and still provide the deep link and request ID. Do not pretend the QR was shown.

## Discover first: `regent_capabilities`

**Call `regent_capabilities` at the start of every new conversation.** Every call hits the wire and returns the wallet's current state — the cache was removed in plugin v0.0.84 so you don't have to worry about stale primaries / accounts after the user changes wallet state. (The tool still accepts a `refresh` parameter for API stability but it's a no-op.)

The tool returns:

- **Wallet descriptor**: name, version, protocol, supported features.
- **Identities**: the signing identities (public keys / DIDs) the user has provisioned. Primary identities carry a `bip_method` field (e.g. `BIP32-Ed25519`).
- **Accounts grouped by chain**: e.g. `algorand: [ADDR…]`, `base: [0x…]`, `solana: [...]`. These are the **real signing addresses** for derived (transactable) accounts — don't guess.
- **Primary accounts grouped by BIP derivation method**: e.g. `BIP32-Ed25519: [<pubkey>…]`, `SLIP10-Ed25519: [<pubkey>…]`. Primaries are identity-only roots (no transactable address); they're surfaced by derivation method rather than chain because a primary key is chain-agnostic at the user-visible layer.
- **This agent's own descriptor**: version + the `sig_hint`s this plugin can verify.

Use the result to:

1. Pick a `sig_hint` the wallet **actually** supports — not just one the protocol catalog lists. The wallet implements a subset. Each identity's `bip_method` tells you that key's curve (`*-Ed25519` → that key signs `raw-ed25519`, not `raw-secp256k1` — different curves, a cryptographic fact, not a setting); the chains under `accounts` tell you which `message-*`/`transaction-*` hints exist. A `raw-*` hint is available only if **some** identity in the list has the matching curve, so scan all identities before concluding. Don't request `transaction-solana` with no Solana account, or `raw-secp256k1` when every identity is Ed25519. See [Which of these can my wallet actually do?](#which-of-these-can-my-wallet-actually-do).
2. Reference real addresses in the `description` (e.g. `"Sign in as <did>"`, `"Send 5 USDC from <base addr>"`) — never invented placeholders.
3. Detect "no live session" early and prompt the user to connect their wallet instead of failing in `regent_sign`.

Call again any time you want fresh state — there's no penalty for re-calling within a conversation. WebRTC round-trip on the local data channel is sub-millisecond.

## The core loop: sign → verify

1. Call **`regent_sign`** with the bytes to sign, a human-readable `description`, and the right `sig_hint`.
2. The wallet shows the user an approval modal; they pick the account/identity and confirm.
3. On approval you get back a base64 `signature` plus the signer's `public_key` (or EVM `address`).
4. Optionally call the **matching verifier** to confirm the signature locally (pure, no round-trip).

`regent_sign` returns `{ status: "rejected", reason }` if the user declines — treat that as a normal outcome, not an error, and tell the user what was declined.

## Pick the right `sig_hint` (this is the part that goes wrong)

`sig_hint` selects the curve, prefix, and encoding the wallet applies. Each one has exactly one verifier: **`regent_verify_<sig_hint with - → _>`**.

> **This table is the protocol catalog — the full set of hints Regent *defines* and this agent can *verify*. It is NOT a list of what the connected wallet supports.** Wallets implement a subset. A row appearing here does not mean your wallet can produce that signature. The wallet's `regent_capabilities` response is the only authority on what's actually available — see [Which of these can my wallet do?](#which-of-these-can-my-wallet-actually-do) below. Requesting a hint the wallet can't fulfil gets rejected.

| `sig_hint` | `key_type` | Chain / use | Verifier tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| `raw-ed25519` | identity | Algorand/Solana identity, off-chain attestation/VC | `regent_verify_raw_ed25519` |
| `raw-secp256k1` | identity | Base/EVM identity, off-chain | `regent_verify_raw_secp256k1` |
| `message-algorand` | account | Algorand signed message (ARC-60) | `regent_verify_message_algorand` |
| `message-evm` | account | EVM `personal_sign` (EIP-191) | `regent_verify_message_evm` |
| `message-solana` | account | Solana signed message | `regent_verify_message_solana` |
| `typed-data-evm` | account | EVM EIP-712 typed data | `regent_verify_typed_data_evm` |
| `transaction-algorand` | account | Sign an Algorand transaction | `regent_verify_transaction_algorand` |
| `transaction-evm` | account | Sign an EVM transaction | `regent_verify_transaction_evm` |
| `transaction-solana` | account | Sign a Solana transaction | `regent_verify_transaction_solana` |

**`key_type` must match the hint:** `identity` → `raw-*` only (DID-bound key, never holds funds — for sign-in, attestations, VCs, AP2 mandates). `account` → `message-*` / `typed-data-evm` / `transaction-*` (on-chain account key). Defaults to `account`.

Omitting `sig_hint` falls back to plain Ed25519-over-raw-bytes (works only for an Algorand identity key; anything else is rejected with `sig_hint_required`). **Always set `sig_hint` explicitly** so the wallet applies the correct chain encoding.

### Which of these can my wallet actually do?

The capabilities response does **not** hand you a ready-made list of supported `sig_hint`s. You derive it from the wallet's identities and accounts. Match the request to what's present, not to what the table above lists:

- **Identity hints (`raw-*`) are gated by the curve of each individual identity key**, read from that identity's `bip_method`. Curves don't cross — an Ed25519 private key cannot produce a secp256k1 signature and vice versa; this is math, not a wallet setting:
  - An identity with `BIP32-Ed25519` / `SLIP10-Ed25519` (Ed25519 curve) can sign `raw-ed25519`, **not `raw-secp256k1`**.
  - An identity with a secp256k1 derivation method can sign `raw-secp256k1`, not `raw-ed25519`.
  - A wallet may list several identities of **different** curves, so evaluate per hint across the whole list: `raw-ed25519` is available if *any* identity is Ed25519; `raw-secp256k1` if *any* identity is secp256k1. Only when **every** identity is Ed25519 (e.g. the list is just `[BIP32-Ed25519]`) is `raw-secp256k1` genuinely unavailable — and then it's rejected no matter what the protocol catalog lists.
- **Account hints (`message-*` / `typed-data-evm` / `transaction-*`) are gated by the chains under `accounts`:**
  - `algorand` accounts → `message-algorand`, `transaction-algorand`.
  - `base`/EVM accounts → `message-evm`, `typed-data-evm`, `transaction-evm`.
  - `solana` accounts → `message-solana`, `transaction-solana`.
  - No accounts for a chain → none of that chain's hints are available; don't request them.

When in doubt, pick the hint whose curve/chain you can point to a concrete identity or address for in the `regent_capabilities` output. If the user asks for something the wallet can't sign (e.g. an EVM identity signature on an Ed25519-only wallet), say so and tell them what their wallet *can* do — don't fire a request you already know will be rejected.

## Payloads

- `payload_base64` is the **raw** bytes — the wallet adds the chain prefix/encoding itself based on `sig_hint`. Don't pre-prefix.
- For `transaction-*`, pass the **canonical unsigned-transaction bytes** (Algorand msgpack / EVM RLP / Solana serialized). The wallet returns the signed form.
- `display_hint` (`text` | `json` | `hex`) only controls how the modal *renders* the payload — no cryptographic effect. Set it when the auto-detected preview would be unhelpful.

## Good `description` values

The `description` is the only thing the user reads before approving — make it specific and honest. Examples: `"Sign in to BankApp as alice@example.com"`, `"Approve transfer of 5 USDC to 0x1234…abcd"`, `"Issue an AP2 payment mandate for $20/mo"`. Vague descriptions like `"sign this"` get declined.

## If there's no connection

These tools require a live Regent session (the wallet paired and connected). If `regent_sign` reports no active session, call `regent_pair` to get a QR code / deep link, show it to the user so they can scan it with their wallet, and check `regent_status` — don't retry signing in a loop.

## Paying for HTTP resources (x402)

Some HTTP endpoints require a small on-chain payment to access (the **x402** protocol). You can pay for them with the **user's wallet** — you never hold funds; the user approves and signs each payment in-wallet. The tools are all `_regent`-suffixed (so they never clash with a separate local x402 MCP):

- `x402_discover_payment_requirements_regent` — probe an endpoint and see what it costs, **without** paying.
- `make_http_request_with_x402_regent` — call the endpoint and pay automatically from the wallet. It builds the payment; the user approves + signs in their wallet (e.g. Regent shows the amount, asset, and recipient); then the request is retried with the payment attached.
- `bazaar_list_regent` / `bazaar_search_regent` / `bazaar_get_resource_details_regent` — browse/search the Bazaar directory of paid API resources (no payment, no wallet needed).

**Before paying:** call `regent_capabilities` and confirm the wallet has an **Algorand account** (under `accounts.algorand`). The payment comes from that account.

**Choosing the paying account (important):**
- If the wallet has **exactly one** Algorand account, `make_http_request_with_x402_regent` uses it automatically — pass nothing extra.
- If the wallet has **more than one** Algorand account, the tool does NOT guess: it returns `needsPayerSelection: true` with the account list instead of paying. **Ask the user which account to pay from**, then call the tool again with `payerAddress` set to their choice.

**Budget:** pass `maxAmountPerRequest` (USDC atomic units; 1,000,000 = $1.00) to cap spend. If a requirement exceeds it, the call refuses rather than over-paying.

If the tool reports no Algorand account or no live session, tell the user to connect/pair their wallet (or add an Algorand account) — don't retry in a loop.

**ALWAYS confirm the payment with an explorer link.** After a successful `make_http_request_with_x402_regent`, find the on-chain transaction id in the tool's response (it's in the settlement info — typically `paymentResponse`, e.g. a `txId`/`transaction` field; the response also carries `paid.network`) and reply to the user with a clickable explorer link to that transaction, chosen by network:

- **testnet** → `https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/<TXID>` (Lora)
- **mainnet** → `https://allo.info/tx/<TXID>` (allo.info)

Example: `Paid 0.5 USDC ✓ — https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/transaction/PH4OF7FW5DIRRFFHSFMN5X722UFUQEA4G4VDUVYVL3LFXZ5RO4SQ`. Always include this link so the user can verify the payment on-chain.

## Multi-agent conferences (Regent star routing)

The wallet user can pull several agents into ONE conversation. In a conference, chat messages arrive as single-line attributed text:

- `User says: <text>` — the human speaking to the room.
- `@<Nickname> says: <text>` — another agent speaking. Nicknames are the connection names the user gave each agent in Regent (often the platform name: OpenClaw, Claude, Codex).

Plain unattributed messages mean a normal 1:1 chat — none of this section applies.

**Conference etiquette — follow strictly to avoid conversation loops:**

1. **Address agents explicitly.** When your reply is meant for another agent, START it with their `@Nickname` exactly as attributed (e.g. `@Codex your step 3 misses the retry case`). When answering the user, do not @mention any agent.
2. **Respond only when addressed.** Contribute when `User says:` asks for something you should handle, or when another agent @mentions your nickname (or your platform name) with a question or request. **If nothing is needed from you, say NOTHING to the room: make your entire final message exactly `NO_REPLY`** — that token is intercepted and never delivered to the room.
3. **Acknowledgements end threads — never reply to one.** If a message is only thanks / agreement / "ok" / a closing summary, make your final message exactly `NO_REPLY`. Do not send acknowledgements yourself.
4. **No narration — ever.** Never send commentary about your own actions or the conversation state ("I answered…", "both answers are in", "nothing further needed from me"). Either contribute substance, or make your final message exactly `NO_REPLY`.
5. **Don't invite infinite replies.** End contributions with your answer. Only end with a question to another agent when you genuinely cannot proceed without their input.
6. **Never echo.** Do not quote or repeat another agent's message back; reference it briefly ("re your point on X…").
7. **Wrap up to the user.** When the task concludes, summarize to the user with no @mentions — that lets the room settle.
